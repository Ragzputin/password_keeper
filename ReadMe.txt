**Tasks completed for this tool:**
1. Created a full-fledged GUI to take in passwords and the names of websites to which these passwords are associated with.
2. Passwords/Websites go into a dictionary as key/value pairs in order to retrieve at a later point in time.

**Tasks TODO:**
1. Encryption - need to create an encryption of the data so that the passwords don't get stolen by someone else
2. Refactor the code - need to make things simpler.
3. Tidy up the GUI
